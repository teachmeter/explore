## 4. <a name='Tooling'></a>Tooling

- VS Code
  - Extension: Better PHPUnit ([video](https://laracasts.com/series/visual-studio-code-for-php-developers/episodes/10))
    - Configure CTRL + T to run tests, CTRL SHIFT + T to rerun
- PHPUnit ([doc 8.0](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/8.0/installation.html))
  - Recommended to install per project:
    - `composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^|version|`
    - e.g. `composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^8`
    - Included with dev dependencies on the laravel framework.
  - Install globally, configure **phpunit.bat** and add to path (not recommended but useful for running from the command line).

## 5. <a name='ThreeLawsOfTDD'></a>Three Laws of TDD

> Over the years I have come to describe Test Driven Development in terms of three simple rules. They are:
>
> 1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
> 2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
> 3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## 7. <a name='ProjectWithTests'></a>Project With Tests

- [ ] [October CMS](https://github.com/octobercms/october) - Based on Laravel, on setup there is a full set of tests to run. (Runtime ~10 min - with xdebug on), turn xdebug off if not generating reports
  - [ ] October has been installed and run, examine the tests in more detail, what are they testing, etc.
- [ ] [Laravel Boilerplate](http://laravel-boilerplate.com/) - Tests take 10 min to run (with xdebug on), turn xdebug off if not generating reports
  - [ ] Laravel Boilerplate has been installed and run, examine the tests in more detail, what are they testing, etc.

## 8. <a name='Conclusion'></a>Conclusion

Notes are still ongoing and may not necessarily make sense out of context.

- TDD, when used correctly are good.
- Documentation can be created from well named tests.
- Test behaviour not implementations.
- Testing is an art, there isn't a right way for everything.
- Testing takes practice
- Try to use real objects rather than mock data.
- Tests should be trustworthy.
- Anna Filina (Recap)
  - Write a test to prove what is being tested works.
  - Write tests when you see a bug
  - Write test when you improve code
  - Write tests as you write new code
  - Write tests before you write code
  - Text unexpected scenarios
  - Testing = Pre-emptive Debugging
- Google
  - Small - like unit testing
  - Medium
  - Large - acceptance testing
- Mocking can cause dependencies or coupling.
- Ensure that both success and failure cases are covered by appropriate unit tests
- There's a lot of value in reading books on good coding and design practices even if they don't focus on unit testing
- TDD is recommended for any long lasting project which may need new features in the future.
